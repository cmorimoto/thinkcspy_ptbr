    <h3 id="license">Q: Can I use CodeMirror in my such-and-such project?</h3>

    <p>A: Yes. The <a href="LICENSE">license</a> is short, simple, and
    permissive.</p>

    <h3 id="cache">Q: You said you fixed this-and-this issue, but I'm
    still seeing it.</h3>

    <p>A: One possibility is that I screwed up, but a very real
    alternative is that you're looking at a cached version of the
    CodeMirror scripts. Because the scripts are loaded into an iframe,
    the ctrl-f5 you issued on the outer page doesn't always cause them
    to be reloaded (IE, Opera, and Firefox are the worst offenders
    here). Clear your cache and re-try.</p>

    <h3 id="textarea">Q: I can't put content containing
    <code>&lt;/textarea></code> into CodeMirror!</h3>

    <p>A: [Web-programming 101] The first <code>&lt;/textarea></code>
    following a <code>&lt;textarea></code> tag will close the
    textarea. This has nothing to do with CodeMirror. Sit down, and
    spend ten minutes thinking about why HTML-escaping was
    invented.</p>

    <h3 id="debug">Q: I have this huge chunk of code that does not
    work, can you debug it for me?</h3>

    <p>A: Nope. If you can't be bothered isolate your problem in 20
    lines of code or less, I can't be bothered to think about it.</p>

    <h3 id="patch">Q: How do I submit patches for CodeMirror?</h3>

    <p>A: Preferred way is to create a fork on <a
    href="http://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror">github</a>, add your
    patch, and send me a pull request. Diffs (against the latest
    version!) by mail are also cool.</p>
