From me:

I just thought of a possible solution for those nasty CSS clashes that
you guys are encountering:

I could prefix all of my python tutor CSS rules with something like
div.ExecutionVisualizer. e.g., 

div.ExecutionVisualizer table td {
  ... blah blah ...
}

and then when the user creates an ExecutionVisualizer object with
JavaScript and passes it a div, I use JavaScript to set its class to
"ExecutionVisualizer".

Thoughts?

From John:

That's a good idea.  It would also be great to establish two different
top-level div classes: one for embedded and one for stand-alone
visualizers.  Embedded visualizers typically need to be more densely
laid out, otherwise they eat up the entire page.  You can see my css
changes for embedding in the master branch of my fork.

Ideally, I'd add the option of creating an embedded visualizer or a
stand-alone one on construction, and each would be allowed to have
different styles but mostly share the same styles.

From Sean:

Philip, just wondering, could you just make a new container div with the
right class, and stick it into the div passed to your code?  This might
be easier than fiddling with the class on the div the user gives, and
I'm also wondering whether there could be unforeseen interactions with
other classes that might have been prespecified on that div. I don't
know what the downsides of the new approach are, though.

My thoughts:

- maybe just have a set of css styles for a standalone visualizer, and
  then add an option or something to flip a bit to make it embedded ...
  if the visualizer is embedded, then use js to set css for certain
  attributes

2012-08-29 email from me to John and Sean:

Gentlemen -

I just pushed some changes that implemented:

- Sean's suggestion of creating a div.ExecutionVisualizer within the root DOM node passed into a new ExecutionVisualizer object,
- prefixing of all CSS rules by div.ExecutionVisualizer
- some of John's modified CSS

Hopefully CSS clashes are less of a problem from now on.

However, I still didn't implement John's suggestion for an "embedded CSS mode" yet; right now the best thing to do is to either tweak the CSS manually or to write javascript to dynamically modify the CSS.
